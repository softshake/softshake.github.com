Alice: Hey Bob, ready for the Big Release. Everything working?
Bob: Yeah, sure. Why not?
Alice: I don't know. Did you test your code?
Bob: Of course. All the tests pass. What could possibly go wrong?
Alice: Well, I guess, nothing… Let's release and go to soft-shake.
Sounds familiar? We all know how this story ends… and it's not with Bob and Alice having fun at soft-shake. Unacceptable!

In this talk, I will show how to uncover the power of dynamic analysis to improve the coverage of your tests and find bugs before your users. I will describe the techniques to automatically create more tests starting from a single, simple unit test, and demonstrate how it helps JavaScript developers create better code.
