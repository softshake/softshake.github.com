Have you already struggled with thousands of lines of Javascript code, maintained by many developers over a few years?

STJS (Strongly-Typed JavaScript) is a Java-to-JavaScript transpiler that outputs readable, recognizable code without imposing any extra frameworks.

In this presentation you’ll learn the main features of STJS and how it helped us with our project. You’ll discover how you can bring the strong and static typing of Java together with the fantastic existing Java tooling to your JavaScript code. You’ll see how easy it is to use jQuery when you don’t have to look up the documentation every time to find out the exact usage of a method, and how easy it is to use JUnit to run Javascript unit tests directly in your browser.
