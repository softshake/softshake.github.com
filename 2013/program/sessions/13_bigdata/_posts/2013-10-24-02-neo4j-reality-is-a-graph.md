Big data is a thing.
Clever data is another.

And Neo4J can handle both. The leader graph database allows you to leverage rich and complex interactions in your data in a very expressive way.

During this talk, you will learn about basic APIs, traversals and querying with Cypher as well as its integration with Spring Data.
