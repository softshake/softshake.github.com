Learn more about the tools, techniques and technologies for working productively with data at any scale. This session will introduce the family of data analytics tools on AWS which you can use to collect, compute and collaborate around data, from gigabytes to petabytes. We'll discuss Amazon Elastic MapReduce, Hadoop, structured and unstructured data, and the EC2 instance types which enable high performance analytics.
