The session will focus on building modern lightweight HTTP services for a whole plethora of clients with ASP.NET Web API. 

We will discuss how it fits into the existing .NET landscape and go through different Web API usage scenarios: RESTful APIs, AJAX backends, scalabale decoupled systems, desktop applications, Windows services, mobile applications, cross system communication. We will also argue why embracing HTTP is so important in modern day web development. 

Finally, we shall also take a deep dive into different hosting modes of Web API: self-hosting, web-hosting, in-memory-hosting, and look into the benefits of OWIN.
