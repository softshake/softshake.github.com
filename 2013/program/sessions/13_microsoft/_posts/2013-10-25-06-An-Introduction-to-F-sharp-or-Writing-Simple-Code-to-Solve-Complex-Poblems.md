F# is a fully CLI compatible, Apache 2.0 open source-licensed programming language available on all major platforms.

This talk will give an overview of the main features who distinguish F# from current mainstream langauges. Some of these features have a long tradition in functional-first programming, some are genuinely new inventions who might well set a trend for the future.

The talk will explain what lies behind the F# motto “Writing Simple Code to Solve Complex Poblems”, and why many people report producing fewer bugs in F#. We will end the session by accessing World Bank data live, in a type-safe way, using an F# managed type provider.
