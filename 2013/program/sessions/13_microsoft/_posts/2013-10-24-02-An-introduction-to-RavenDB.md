In all the hype for NoSQL it got almost forgotten that there are already great products that can ease our work. One of those is RavenDB. With this document oriented database we finally have an easy and agile way to handle the persistence layer.

We can now focus on the code of the application and the database is just an implementation detail. No longer do we need to spend hours to find the perfect database schema that must be right the first time â€“ we figure it out as we learn more about the application. But this flexibility comes to a price. The well understood concepts of tables and SQL are gone and LINQ and Map/Reduce need to be learned.

In this presentation you will see how easy you can enter the new and shiny world of noSQL and how RavenDB will influence your thinking about data storage and software architecture in general.
