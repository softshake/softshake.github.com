Working on a business project is intensive, time-consuming and tiring. Tight deadlines often make developers produce the infamous "enterprise" code, the quality of which is the least important factor. "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act, but a habit" Aristotle used to say. Deploying our skills, however, is almost mutually exclusive from mastering them. The rule of thumb is that the more frequently we repeat our shoddy techniques, the more difficult it is to get rid of them! 

In this session we will cover 33 things you want to do better, quicker and simpler applying the best of Akka, Guava, Guice, Mockito, Spock, Byteman, Groovy, Gradle, Logback, Bash, Pomodoro and others!
Using some real-life examples related to design, coding, testing and productivity we will have a peek at the code, analyze the flaw and propose a suitable solution.
Not only will we learn how to code better, but more importantly, how to raise the bar on a daily basis. Come by and power up your craftsmanship!
