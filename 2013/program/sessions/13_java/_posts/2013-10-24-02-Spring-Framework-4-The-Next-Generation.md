Spring Framework 4.0 is the next generation of the popular open source framework for Enterprise Java developers, focusing on the future with support for Java SE 8 and Java EE 7. In this presentation core Spring committer Sam Brannen will provide attendees an overview of the new enterprise features in the framework as well as new programming models made possible with the adoption of JDK 8 language features and APIs.

Specifically, this talk will cover support for lambda expressions and method references against Spring callback interfaces, JSR-310 Date-Time value types for Spring data binding and formatting, Spring's new @Conditional mechanism for activation of bean definitions, and a new WebSocket endpoint model. Regarding enterprise APIs, the presentation will cover Spring 4.0's new support for JMS 2.0, JPA 2.1, Bean Validation 1.1, Servlet 3.1, JCache, and JSR-236 concurrency. Last but not least, Sam will discuss improvements to Spring's testing support and point out which deprecated APIs have been pruned from the framework.
