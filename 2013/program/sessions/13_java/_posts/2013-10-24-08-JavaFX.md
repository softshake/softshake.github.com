Since more than a decade, the way to develop rich Java client hasn't evolved. JavaFX 2 is the right successor of Swing and has a lot of new features. You will discover what's new in JavaFX 2 and how getting started by using amongst others things FXML, with which it is possible to easily create complete user interfaces. Useful components, their whole customisation with CSS, their creation and reusability will also be presented to you. You will see how easy it is to do it! Other JavaFX advantages like the multitouch implementation, the drag and drop, images manipulation won't be forgotten, all with demos!
