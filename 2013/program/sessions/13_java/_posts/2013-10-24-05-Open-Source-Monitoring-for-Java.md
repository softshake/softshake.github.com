Fast feedback from monitoring is a key of Continuous Delivery. JMX is the right Java API to do so but it unfortunately stayed underused and underappreciated as it was difficult to connect to monitoring and graphing systems. Throw in the sin bin the poor solutions based on log files and weakly secured web interfaces! 

A new generation of Open Source tooling based on JMX and Graphite makes it easy to graph java application metrics, including business indicators, and integrate them to traditional monitoring systems like Nagios. 

Following the logic of DevOps, we will look together how best to integrate the monitoring dimension in a project: from design to development, to QA and finally to production on both traditional deployment and in the Cloud. Come and discover how the JmxTrans-Graphite ticket can make your life easier.
