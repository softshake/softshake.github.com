Most methods to organize your processes are either hard to learn or a burden to work with – and far too often both. Kanban is different. The signalling system from Toyota found its way around the globe into the management of software products. Its simplicity and the power to adapt makes Kanban a useful tool to manage your tasks. If you just want to plan your holidays or an important release of your application – the method stays the same but you are allowed to adapt the process without being called an outcast.

After using Kanban for more than two years I would like to share my experience. As it turns out Kanban is not a silver bullet but it can give you a great chance to optimize your workflow and boost your productivity.
