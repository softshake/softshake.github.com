Based on the speaker’s experience as a Software Engineering Executive, the session will provide honest feedback on the following questions:

* Does SCRUM work in real life?
* How to improve my (or my management’s) chances of succeeding in implementing the SCRUM methodology?
* How long will it take?

The discussion will be structured around two real change management processes with a few very (very!) different companies and will include very transparent hands-on recommendations.

*Target audience*

Developers, project managers, mangers and senior managers who know something about agile methodologies.
