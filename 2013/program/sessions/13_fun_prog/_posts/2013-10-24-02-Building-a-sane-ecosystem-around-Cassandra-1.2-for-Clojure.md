This talk will explore two libraries, a Cassandra native CQL client (1) and a Clojure DSL for writing CQL3 queries (2).

This will demonstrate how Cassandra and Clojure are a great fit, show the strength of the functional approach to this domain and how in particular the data centric nature of Clojure makes a lot of sense in this context.

Depending on the program of the conference this talk would begin by a 5min crash course on Clojure essentials and 2min intro to Cassandra to understand what follows.
