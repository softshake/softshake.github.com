Businesses often suffer from not knowing precise numbers, many decisions are taken rather blindly, without analysis and projection. Even basic event aggregation and statistics can give an amazing amount of information for decision making, anomaly detection and projection.

Eventoverse is an open source toolchain built in Clojure that helps you to collect, process, persist and analyze events in a post-hoc manner. You'll get to know how to get more data from your systems, be it business or application metrics, analyze and represent it in a way that serves best you and your team.
