Introduction on datascience with clojure, cascalog (maybe more...) with optional (but highly recommended) hands-on.
The presentation will be mostly code driven with several possible directions :

* cascalog intro with real use case
* implementation of machine learning algorithms in clojure
* comparison with scikit-learn , R
