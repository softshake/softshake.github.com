This presentation will explain the advantages of making mobile applications work offline, and will provide a full-stack how-to.
This how-to will cover the device side, the REST API and the server back-end.
The talk will walk through the implementation of a native iOS application that works offline, and will provide a quick presentation of what the equivalent could be on other platforms (Android, hybrid apps).
The API discussion will take the couchdb REST API as an example, as it inspired this talk's REST API. Finally a django/postgres alternative implementation will be presented.
