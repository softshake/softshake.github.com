Benchmarking - it is so simple! Twice System.nanoTime(), took the difference, and done, let's do optimization. Certainly not!

This presentation is about how to investigate performance of applications using benchmarks. Which common errors arise, how to deal with them, and how do get at least some useful information about the world, where everything depends on everything. All this with help of Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH), standard harness for writing benchmarks in OpenJDK, developed by the best Oracle performance engineers.
