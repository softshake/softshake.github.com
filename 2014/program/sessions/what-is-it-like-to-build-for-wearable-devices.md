In this presentation I'll share an overview of my experience building Evernote apps for a range of wearables: what worked, what didn't, what would I do differently.  

I'll also give a live demo of building a new app for Android Wear, explaining core concepts and techniques and answering questions.  Expect to see plenty of code.

If everyone in the audience is comfortable with French I'll give the presentation in French, but otherwise it will be in English.
