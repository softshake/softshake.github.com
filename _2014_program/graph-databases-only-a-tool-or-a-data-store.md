Graph databases provide a modern and efficient solution to store graph-oriented data structures naturally. Many structured and associated data are stored schema free in vertices (nodes) and edges (relations) without using an index to query. With the known algorithms from graph theory, we can succeed to answer our questions on the connected data.

This talk provides an introduction to the topic of graph databases and compares them with relational databases. Issues such as data modelling, querying, data import and typical use cases are considered and compared in detail. In addition, issues such as the integration into the system environment, etc. are covered as well.
